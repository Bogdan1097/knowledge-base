# Transaction

Transaction is joined sequence of commands (operations) to modify the TokenD's ledger state. All 
actions in the TokenD network can be represented by corresponding transactions.
For example, transactions are used to send payments, manage orders, change
account settings and etc. If you think of the ledger as a database, then 
operations are SQL commands and transactions are database transactions.

## Transaction attributes

Each transaction has the following attributes:

* Source account
* Salt
* List of operations
* Time bounds (optional)
* Memo (optional)

### Source account

This is the account that is the parental for the transaction. The transaction 
must be signed by this account.

### Salt
Any 64-bit unsigned integer to ensure the uniqueness of each transaction. 
Usually it is a random number.

### List of operations

Transactions contain an arbitrary list of [operations][3] inside them. Generally 
there is just one operation, but TokenD allow you to have up to 100 operations 
into one transaction. Operations are executed in order as one [ACID][1] 
transaction, meaning that either all operations are applied or none are. 
Thus if any operation fails, the whole transaction fails.

### Time bounds

The [UNIX][2] timestamps, determined by ledger time. It contains `minTime` and 
`maxTime` attributes that means a lower and upper bound, respectively, of 
when this transaction will be valid. If a transaction is submitted too 
early or too late, it will fail to make it into the transaction set. 
`maxTime` equals `0` means that itâ€™s not set.

> Note: But there can be a situation when the local time of the client has 
been changed manually. Therefore, to form the time bounds, it is better to 
use the current TokenD server time received by a special request.

### Memo

The memo contains optional extra information. It is the responsibility of the 
client to interpret this value. Memos can be one of the following types:

* `MEMO_TEXT`: A string up to 28-bytes long.
* `MEMO_ID`: A 64-bit unsigned integer.
* `MEMO_HASH`: A 32-byte hash.
* `MEMO_RETURN`: A 32-byte hash intended to be interpreted as the hash of the 
transaction the sender is refunding.
